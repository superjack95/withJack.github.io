## Binary Search Trees

#### Problem (for better understanding) 

##### Runway reservation system. (problem requirement and actual data structures)

- Airport with a single runway.
- Reservations for future landings.
- Reserve request specifies landing time t.
- Add t to the set R if no other landings are scheduled within k mins. 
- Remove from set R after the plane lands.
- |R| = n, complexity :O(lg(n)).

##### Examples. 

- now: 37. booked: 41.2, 49, 56.3. k = 3
- add 53: ok / add 44: not allowed / add 20: not allowed(past)

##### Solutions. 

- ###### with unsorted list/array

  Insert takes O(1) time w/o check. w/ check takes O(n) time.

- ######sorted array

  Use BST(Binary Search Trees) which takes O(lgn) to find the correct place. (R[i] >= t)

  Constant time for check validity. (R[i] and R[i-1] against t)

  Actual insertion takes O(n) time due to shifting. (array)

  ##### question! : why not list? 

  ​	List can do insertion in constant time but cannot use BST when finding the correct place

  ##### question! : what about Heaps?

  ​	Checking if the element is >= k or <= k from t takes O(n) time

  ​	Even after the insertion, there are still elements in the heap tree that needs to be compared.



- ###### BST (final solution)

  node x : `key (x)`

  unlike heap, has pointers: `parent(x)`, `left(x)`, `right(x)`

  Invariant: For all nodes x, if y is in the left subtree of x, `key(y) <= key(x)`. Similar with the right child.

  Example. (k = 3)

  ​	Insert 49, 79, 46, 41, 42.  => ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31638192/43797700-30a82cf8-9ac3-11e8-885e-42d5e3934b74.png)


  ​	42 is not inserted because it is not greater than 41 by k(=3).

  Complexity: O(h). h is height of tree.



##### Interfaces for BST

`find-min()`

​	: go to the left till leaf. 

​	Complexity: O(h)

`next-larger(x)`

​	Complexity: O(h)

###### new requirement: how many planes are scheduled to land at times <= t?

​	Add new variable that tells subtree sizes. 

​		Insert or delete modify this size numbers.

​		Implement by incrementing 1 the element's parent's size recursively.

​	solution: 

​		find the place as if it were `insert()`. 

​		add in the nodes that are smaller.

​		add in the subtree size to the left.

​		Example. 

​			t = 79. 

​			49 => add1

​			add 2 (subtree 46)

​			79 => add 1

​			= 4

​		Complexity = O(h).

##### Problem case

- When the BST nodes only have right children. 

  this is no differ from list.

  => Balanced BST.

  => h = lg(n)
